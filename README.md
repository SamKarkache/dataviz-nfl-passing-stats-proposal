# NFL Passing Statistics Data Visualization Project

## Data
The dataset(s) that I propose to use for my project are the NFL passing statistics data from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/), particularly the statistics from the past 10 seasons (2014 to 2023). They are linked as follows
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2022/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2017/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2016/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/passing.htm
* https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2014/passing.htm
An important thing to note is that the implementation will only consider players who play the quarterback position. In certain situations, players who do not play quarterback attempt passing plays are credited with passing statistics. These players will be filtered out in the visualization.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * (insert your question or task here) How does the X vary over time?
 * (insert your question or task here) Is there any correlation between X and Y?
 * (insert your question or task here) Are there interesting spatial patterns in X?
 * (insert your question or task here) How many X are there across different Y?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
